In the game you play as a protagonist that wanders lightheartedly through a forest as you hear a distant squeaking. It is a slime! And it is starving!

You are now at a crossroads: Do you want to help **keeping it alive** (the theme, tada!) or do you want to leave it there starving?

You can feed the slime resources that are scattered on the forest floor. But keep an eye on its needs. When it comes to food it is rather picky.

**A big thanks goes to Lunaventor.** She provided me with the sound effects for the slime.
